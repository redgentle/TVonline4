				which can fit to most places and offer quality and stability of the<br>
				overall product. <br>
				<br>
				<span>Second,</span> we have completed revamped our power supply adapter<br>
				and add a power switch at the back of the device to allow the user<br>
				to reboot/reset the box without removing the power supply adapter.<br>
				Third, we have added Optical sound that required for some<br>
				Sound systems to enjoy high quality sounds.<br>
				<br>
				<span>Fourth,</span> RCU has been completed changed to more reliable,<br>
				sturdy and responsive RCU. It also has keyboard option for<br>
				our users (KODI) if need be.<br>
				<br>
				<span>Fifth,</span> we will support all the most popular middleware solutions<br>
				on the market through apps. However, Nova Middleware will be<br>
				fully activated on the TVonline 4 to let the user and operator<br>
				experience lighting fast load times and very strong security options.<br>
				<br>
				We have made these changes to have the most advanced, reliable,<br>
				and up to date, sleek box with lots of additional interesting features.<br>
				We had additionally added a Bluetooth option for multi functions for<br>
				the end user, Google voice recognition function and updated OS.<br>
